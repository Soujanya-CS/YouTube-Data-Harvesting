        "This is fantastic. We have a similar requirement for our client and this will be really helpful us. I have one question though. When we are making inline edits on the LWC component, will it get reflected on the TCRM dashboard in real time? I believe the recipe runs after a certain interval of time and only then the dashboard can bring the latest data from SFDC objects. Appreciate any help on this."

Meanwhile I faced one issue. <br>I created recipe, added input data for Accounts , opportunities and cases. After joining accounts and opportunities when I select account id as lookup , in preview section I&#39;m not able to see any records. Same issue while joining Account and case as well. In my salesforce org there are records for all the 3 objects but not able to see in preview section in recipe after join, aggregate as well as after transform. Could not find out any solution for this problem? Can you please suggest what would be the reason behind not getting any records during preview after join ? I needed I can share screenshot as well.",
